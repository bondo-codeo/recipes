        <h1>General overview</h1>
            <p>Here, at Bondo LLC, we have a bone to pick with Alfredo recipes that contain any kind of cream, recipes of such spirit make MR.Alfredo roll in his grave and no self respecting person would use cream in his alfredo, but you may ask "but Bondo, then what would be your ideal recipe?" for that my friend, I'd give you a recipe written and directed by us.</p>
            <p>also, image contains parsley but we don't fuck with herbs so take that as you will</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>10 ounces fettuccini pasta</li>
                <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy butter</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>   
            </ul>
        <h1>Preparation</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet melt the butter and add the chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often, making sure not to burn the garlic.</li>
                <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of the heavy butter into a small bowl. Add the egg yolk and beat together; put aside. Pour the remaining butter into the frying pan. Increase the heat to medium-high. As the butter starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Slowly add the butter/egg mixture. You do not want the egg to curdle. Continue whisking until well blended.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the butter. Pour in the remaining Parmesan and the parsley, mix until smooth. Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta.</li>
            </ol>
